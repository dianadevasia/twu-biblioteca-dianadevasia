-> install gradle.

-> Open the project in intellij using gradle.

->Create a file called build.gradle with the following:
    *By default the source files are searched inside src/java/. If the project structure is changed,
     then in sourceSets the path is written.

    *All the dependent libraries are specified inside the dependencies tag.

    *In the manifest tag inside the jar tag, we specify the location of the entry point function.

->To build run the following command:
    :: gradle build

->This would compile all your files and run the tests and
  also create a jar of your source files inside build/libs folder to be run.

->The result of the tests run is generated in the projects reports/tests/index.html file

->It displays the summary of the tests ran and the tests failed.

->Now the project can be run using the command:
    java -jar <path-to-your-project>/build/libs<name-of-the-jar>

-> When the project runs the menu options are displayed.
    1. displaying list of books.
    2. checkout a book.
    3. return the book checked out.
    0. to quit the application.

-> Only books available in the library can be checked out.

-> Only the books checked out by a particular customer can be returned to the library.

-> For checkout & return of books, necessary validations are done to validate the correctness of the book.
